# EDH_tidytext
Experiment with Tidytext and EDH dataset


Hello, I am experimenting with the tidytext package in R on the EDH dataset and I have encountered two interesting errors I have no idea what to do with. 
All mys teps and error messages are described within the script as comments, as well as what I am trying to achieve.

Error 1 - non-utf encoding
1. The script ```EDH_tidy.R```


Error 2 - transposing list in R
1. The script ```EDH_tidy_from_json.R```
